## Integration with Existing Code

The implementation carefully integrates with the existing MCTX codebase:

   - Ensured backward compatibility

3. **Database Schema**
   - Extended existing tables rather than creating new ones
   - Added new fields for metrics
   - Enhanced existing queries

4. **Error Handling**
   - Used existing error types
   - Added validation for new parameters
   - Preserved logging patterns

## Usage Example

```python
from api.app.models.mcts_models import MCTSRequest, SearchParams, RootInput
from api.app.services.mcts_service import MCTSService

# Create T4-optimized request
t4_request = MCTSRequest(
    root_input=root_input,
    search_params=SearchParams(
        num_simulations=128,
        use_t4_optimizations=True,
        precision="fp16",
        tensor_core_aligned=True
    ),
    search_type="gumbel_muzero"
)

# Create distributed request
distributed_request = MCTSRequest(
    root_input=root_input,
    search_params=SearchParams(
        num_simulations=128,
        distributed=True,
        num_devices=4,
        partition_batch=True
    ),
    search_type="gumbel_muzero",
    device_type="gpu"
)

# Run searches
service = MCTSService()
t4_result = service.run_search(t4_request)
distributed_result = service.run_search(distributed_request)
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Hybrid Approach**: Combine T4 optimizations with distributed execution
2. **Auto-Tuning**: Automatically select optimal parameters based on model and hardware
3. **Additional Hardware**: Extend optimizations to other GPU types (V100, A100)
4. **Enhanced Pipelining**: Implement full pipelining in the distributed implementation
5. **Dynamic Load Balancing**: Adjust workload distribution based on device performance
6. **Advanced HANA Features**: Implement HANA Graph, Text Analysis, and Machine Learning
7. **Container Deployment**: Create containerized deployment for Kubernetes environments
