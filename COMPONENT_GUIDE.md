# MCTX Component Guide

This guide helps you understand which MCTX components to use based on your specific needs and use cases.

## Component Overview

MCTX provides a variety of components for different requirements:

| Component | Description | Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Core MCTS | Base Monte Carlo Tree Search | Research, algorithmic experimentation |
| T4 Optimizations | NVIDIA T4 GPU performance enhancements | Production deployment on cloud T4 instances |
| Distributed MCTS | Multi-GPU scaling capabilities | Large-scale search problems |
| SAP HANA Integration | Enterprise database connectivity | Corporate decision intelligence systems |
| FastAPI Backend | Production-ready API service | Web service deployment |
| Visualization | Interactive decision tree visualization | Executive dashboards, decision analysis |

## Decision Flow Chart

Use this flow chart to determine which components you need:

1. **What is your primary goal?**
   - **Research & Development**: Use core MCTS library
   - **Production Deployment**: Continue to question 2

2. **What scale of deployment do you need?**
   - **Single Machine**: Continue to question 3
   - **Multi-Machine Cluster**: Use distributed MCTS + Kubernetes deployment

3. **What hardware are you deploying on?**
   - **CPU Only**: Use core MCTS with CPU configuration
   - **NVIDIA T4 GPUs**: Use T4 optimizations
   - **Other NVIDIA GPUs**: Use core MCTS with GPU configuration

4. **Do you need enterprise integration?**
   - **Yes**: Use SAP HANA integration
   - **No**: Skip HANA components

5. **Do you need visualization?**
   - **For Technical Users**: Use core visualization
   - **For Business Users**: Use business intelligence visualization
   - **Web Dashboard**: Use Vercel frontend
