    # MCTX Enterprise with T4 Optimizations
    
    This blueprint deploys a production-ready Monte Carlo Tree Search platform
    optimized for NVIDIA T4 GPUs. It features:
    
    - Tensor Core-aware pruning strategies for maximum GPU utilization
    - Multi-node scaling capabilities with NCCL collective operations
    - Advanced visualization and monitoring tools
    - Production-grade logging and error handling
    - Comprehensive documentation and examples
    - Memory-optimized SAP HANA integration for handling extremely large trees
    - Batched serialization and incremental loading for memory efficiency
    - Intelligent query caching for improved database performance
    
    ## Getting Started
    
    1. Navigate to the API documentation at port 8000 to explore available endpoints
    2. View interactive visualizations at port 8050
    3. Monitor performance metrics in Grafana at port 3001 (login: admin/admin)
    4. Browse documentation at port 8080

# Hardware recommendations
performance:
  gpu_memory: 16GB
  recommended_gpu: NVIDIA T4
  scaling: |
    For production workloads, the following scaling is recommended:
    - Up to 100 concurrent users: 1x NVIDIA T4
    - Up to 500 concurrent users: 2x NVIDIA T4
    - Up to 1000 concurrent users: 4x NVIDIA T4 or 1x NVIDIA A100
    
    For multi-node deployments, enable the MCTX_ENABLE_MULTI_NODE setting
    and configure the node count and rank for each instance.

# Security information
security:
  authentication: true
  authorization: true
  encryption: true
  notes: |
    - API endpoints are secured with JWT authentication
    - All communication uses HTTPS (configure certificates in production)
    - Sensitive environment variables should be changed in production
    - Review CORS settings for production deployment
