## Overview

FinsightDeep MCTX Enterprise transforms the core MCTX library into a comprehensive decision intelligence platform for enterprise applications, delivering measurable business value through:

- Superior decision modeling with advanced MCTS algorithms
- T4-optimized performance for enterprise workloads
- Distributed computing capabilities for large-scale deployment
- Enterprise integrations (SAP HANA, DataSphere)
- Comprehensive monitoring and visualization
- Production-ready Docker containers

## Features

### Core MCTS Functionality
- JAX-native implementation of MuZero, Gumbel MuZero, and AlphaZero algorithms
- Batched, vectorized simulation for high throughput
- Tree visualization and metrics collection

### Enterprise Extensions
- **T4 Optimization**: Enhanced performance on NVIDIA T4 GPUs
- **Distributed Execution**: Scale across multiple devices
- **SAP Integration**: Connect with enterprise data systems
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics and visualization
- **Enterprise Security**: Role-based access and encryption

## Quick Start

### Docker Deployment

```bash
# Start with GPU support for T4-optimized performance
docker-compose -f docker-compose.nvidia.yml up

# For visualization-only deployment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.nvidia.yml up mctx-vis

# Include monitoring stack (Prometheus + Grafana)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.nvidia.yml up mctx-nvidia prometheus grafana
```

### Port Configuration

| Port | Service | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 8050 | Main Visualization | MCTS tree visualization dashboard |
| 8000 | API Server | REST API for programmatic access |
| 8051 | Secondary Visualization | Alternative visualization interface |
| 9090 | Prometheus | Metrics collection and querying |
| 3001 | Grafana | Interactive monitoring dashboards |

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/plturrell/finsightdeep_mctx_enterprise.git
cd finsightdeep_mctx_enterprise
