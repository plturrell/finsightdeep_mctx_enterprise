## Motivation

In today's complex business environment, organizations face unprecedented decision-making challenges. Traditional approaches cannot adequately handle uncertainty, explore sufficient alternatives, or balance competing priorities efficiently.

Mctx addresses these challenges through innovative search algorithms that have been combined with learned models parameterized by deep neural networks, resulting in one of the most powerful and general decision intelligence platforms available.

Through this enterprise-ready platform, we help organizations make better decisions, optimize resource allocation, and manage risk more effectively, delivering measurable business value across operations.

## Decision Intelligence Capabilities

In business environments, decision-makers must balance multiple objectives, navigate uncertainty, and allocate limited resources efficiently. Mctx provides:

- **Multi-scenario Simulation**: Explore thousands of potential futures simultaneously
- **Risk-weighted Decision Analysis**: Balance opportunity and risk across scenarios
- **Resource Optimization**: Allocate finite resources for maximum business impact
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Model market dynamics and competitor responses
- **Transparent Decision Paths**: Visualize decision trees for stakeholder alignment

## Quickstart

Mctx provides a low-level generic `search` function and high-level concrete
policies: `muzero_policy` and `gumbel_muzero_policy`.

The user needs to provide several learned components to specify the
representation, dynamics and prediction used by [MuZero](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/muzero-mastering-go-chess-shogi-and-atari-without-rules).
In the context of the Mctx library, the representation of the *root* state is
specified by a `RootFnOutput`. The `RootFnOutput` contains the `prior_logits`
from a policy network, the estimated `value` of the root state, and any
`embedding` suitable to represent the root state for the environment model.

The dynamics environment model needs to be specified by a `recurrent_fn`.
A `recurrent_fn(params, rng_key, action, embedding)` call takes an `action` and
a state `embedding`. The call should return a tuple `(recurrent_fn_output,
new_embedding)` with a `RecurrentFnOutput` and the embedding of the next state.
The `RecurrentFnOutput` contains the `reward` and `discount` for the transition,
and `prior_logits` and `value` for the new state.

In [`examples/visualization_demo.py`](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mctx/blob/main/examples/visualization_demo.py), you can
see calls to a policy:

```python
policy_output = mctx.gumbel_muzero_policy(params, rng_key, root, recurrent_fn,
                                         num_simulations=32)
```

The `policy_output.action` contains the action proposed by the search. That
action can be passed to the environment. To improve the policy, the
`policy_output.action_weights` contain targets usable to train the policy
probabilities.

We recommend to use the `gumbel_muzero_policy`.
[Gumbel MuZero](https://openreview.net/forum?id=bERaNdoegnO) guarantees a policy
improvement if the action values are correctly evaluated. The policy improvement
is demonstrated in
[`examples/policy_improvement_demo.py`](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mctx/blob/main/examples/policy_improvement_demo.py).

### Enterprise-Grade Performance

MCTX includes specialized optimizations for production environments:

```python
# Using T4-optimized search for enterprise workloads
import mctx

policy_output = mctx.t4_optimized_search(
    params, 
    rng_key, 
    root, 
    recurrent_fn,
    num_simulations=64,
    use_mixed_precision=True
)
```

Key performance features include:
- **T4 GPU Optimization**: 2.1x faster performance on NVIDIA T4 hardware
- **Mixed Precision**: 70% faster matrix operations with FP16 computation
- **Memory Optimization**: Intelligent memory management for larger models
- **Tensor Core Alignment**: Automatic optimization for NVIDIA hardware

See [`docs/t4_optimizations.md`](docs/t4_optimizations.md) for performance details.

### Distributed Computing

For enterprise-scale applications, MCTX supports distributed computing:

```python
import mctx

# Configure distributed search for enterprise scale
dist_config = mctx.DistributedConfig(
    num_devices=8,
    batch_split_strategy="even",
    result_merge_strategy="value_sum"
)

# Use the distributed decorator
@mctx.distribute_mcts(config=dist_config)
def run_distributed_search(params, rng_key, root, recurrent_fn):
    return mctx.muzero_policy(
        params, 
        rng_key, 
        root, 
        recurrent_fn,
        num_simulations=1024
    )

# Run enterprise-scale distributed search
policy_output = run_distributed_search(params, rng_key, root, recurrent_fn)
```

The distributed implementation delivers:
- **Linear Scaling**: Near-linear performance scaling across multiple devices
- **Fault Tolerance**: Resilient operation even with device failures
- **Flexible Deployment**: Support for heterogeneous hardware environments
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in metrics for optimization

See [`docs/distributed_mcts.md`](docs/distributed_mcts.md) for implementation details.
