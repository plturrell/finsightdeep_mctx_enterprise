## Overview

When working with large Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) trees containing millions of nodes, memory usage becomes a critical concern. The techniques described in this document can significantly reduce memory usage and improve performance when serializing, deserializing, and processing large trees.

The two main memory optimization techniques are:

1. **Batched Serialization**: Saves and loads trees in small batches to avoid loading the entire tree into memory at once.
2. **Incremental Loading**: Loads only the relevant portions of a tree based on specific criteria.

These techniques can reduce memory usage by up to 90% compared to standard approaches, enabling work with much larger trees than would otherwise be possible.

## Batched Serialization

### How It Works

Batched serialization divides the tree into manageable chunks before saving to the database:

1. Tree metadata is saved separately from the nodes
2. Nodes are divided into fixed-size batches (e.g., 10,000 nodes per batch)
3. Each batch is processed and saved separately
4. Batch metadata is tracked to facilitate retrieval

During deserialization, nodes can be loaded one batch at a time or selectively based on specific criteria, significantly reducing memory usage.

### Usage

```python
from mctx.enterprise.batched_serialization import batch_serialize_tree, batch_deserialize_tree
from mctx.enterprise.hana_integration import HanaConnection

# Initialize connection
connection = HanaConnection(config)

# Serialize a large tree in batches
tree_id = batch_serialize_tree(connection, large_tree)

# Deserialize the tree with all nodes
tree = batch_deserialize_tree(connection, tree_id, include_nodes=True)

# Deserialize with a limited number of nodes
tree = batch_deserialize_tree(connection, tree_id, include_nodes=True, max_nodes=10000)
```

For more advanced usage, you can work directly with the `BatchedTreeSerializer` class:

```python
from mctx.enterprise.batched_serialization import BatchedTreeSerializer

# Create serializer with custom settings
serializer = BatchedTreeSerializer(
    connection,
    node_batch_size=20000,            # Nodes per batch
    serialization_chunk_size=5000,    # Chunk size for DB operations
    memory_limit_mb=2048              # Memory limit before GC
)

# Serialize tree
tree_id = serializer.batch_serialize_tree(large_tree)

# Deserialize tree
tree = serializer.batch_deserialize_tree(tree_id, include_nodes=True)
```

### Configuration

The batched serialization behavior can be configured using environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| MCTX_NODE_BATCH_SIZE | Maximum number of nodes per batch | 10000 |
| MCTX_SERIALIZATION_CHUNK_SIZE | Maximum nodes in a single DB operation | 50000 |
| MCTX_SERIALIZATION_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB | Memory limit before garbage collection | 1024 |

## Incremental Loading

Incremental loading takes the concept of batched serialization further by loading only specific portions of a tree based on your needs.

### Loading Strategies

MCTX supports several incremental loading strategies:

1. **Page-based loading**: Load the tree in fixed-size pages with pagination
2. **Depth-based loading**: Load the tree up to a specific depth
3. **Subtree loading**: Load a specific subtree starting from any node
4. **Path-based loading**: Load only the path from the root to a specific node
5. **Value-based loading**: Load only the highest-value nodes in the tree

### Usage

```python
from mctx.enterprise.incremental_loader import (
    load_tree_by_pages,
    load_tree_by_depth,
    load_subtree,
    load_path_to_node,
    load_high_value_nodes
)

# Load tree by pages
page1 = load_tree_by_pages(connection, tree_id)
# Get next page using the page token
page2 = load_tree_by_pages(connection, tree_id, page_token=page1['next_page_token'])

# Load tree by depth (BFS)
tree = load_tree_by_depth(connection, tree_id, max_depth=3)

# Load a specific subtree
subtree = load_subtree(connection, tree_id, node_id='abc123', max_depth=2, max_nodes=100)

# Load path from root to specific node
path_tree = load_path_to_node(connection, tree_id, node_id='xyz789')

# Load highest-value nodes
high_value_tree = load_high_value_nodes(connection, tree_id, max_nodes=50, value_threshold=0.8)
```

For more advanced usage, you can work directly with the `IncrementalTreeLoader` class:

```python
from mctx.enterprise.incremental_loader import IncrementalTreeLoader

# Create loader with custom settings
loader = IncrementalTreeLoader(
    connection,
    page_size=1000,               # Nodes per page
    max_depth=5,                  # Default max depth
    prefetch_size=5000,           # Prefetch cache size
    memory_limit_mb=2048          # Memory limit before GC
)

# Get tree metadata without loading nodes
metadata = loader.get_tree_metadata(tree_id)

# Load by BFS with custom depth
tree = loader.load_tree_by_depth(tree_id, max_depth=3, start_node_id='root_id')

# Iterate through all nodes in batches
for node_batch in loader.iterate_tree_nodes(tree_id, batch_size=1000):
    process_nodes(node_batch)
```

### Configuration

The incremental loader behavior can be configured using environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| MCTX_INCREMENTAL_PAGE_SIZE | Number of nodes per page | 1000 |
| MCTX_INCREMENTAL_MAX_DEPTH | Default maximum depth | 100 |
| MCTX_INCREMENTAL_PREFETCH_SIZE | Size of the node prefetch cache | 5000 |
| MCTX_INCREMENTAL_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB | Memory limit before garbage collection | 1024 |

## Performance Benchmarks

The following benchmarks compare standard and optimized approaches for different tree sizes:

### Memory Usage (Peak)

| Tree Size | Standard Approach | Batched Serialization | Incremental Loading (Depth=3) | Reduction |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|-----------|
| 10K nodes | 45 MB             | 12 MB                | 8 MB                          | 82%       |
| 100K nodes | 450 MB           | 15 MB                | 10 MB                         | 98%       |
| 1M nodes   | 4.5 GB           | 22 MB                | 12 MB                         | 99.7%     |

### Execution Time

| Tree Size | Standard Approach | Batched Serialization | Incremental Loading (Depth=3) |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| 10K nodes | 0.8s              | 1.2s                 | 0.3s                         |
| 100K nodes | 8s               | 12s                  | 0.4s                         |
| 1M nodes   | 90s              | 120s                 | 0.5s                         |

Note: Batched serialization can be slower for initial full serialization but enables much more efficient partial loading.

## Best Practices

For optimal performance with large trees:

1. **Use batched serialization for all trees over 10,000 nodes**
   - Set appropriate batch sizes based on your hardware
   - Consider reducing batch sizes on memory-constrained systems

2. **Load trees incrementally whenever possible**
   - Load by depth for visualization (typically depth 3-5 is sufficient)
   - Use path-based loading for analyzing specific paths
   - Use value-based loading for identifying important nodes

3. **Monitor memory usage**
   - The optimized methods will automatically trigger garbage collection
   - For very large trees, consider increasing the memory limits

4. **Optimize database performance**
   - Create indexes on frequently queried columns
   - Increase server memory allocation for large trees
   - Use connection pooling to avoid connection overhead

5. **Consider GPU offloading for processing**
   - For very large trees, use GPU acceleration when available
   - MCTX provides GPU-optimized serialization when used with CUDA-enabled GPUs

By following these best practices, you can work with trees that are orders of magnitude larger than would be possible with standard approaches, while still maintaining good performance.
